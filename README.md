**Description:** <br>
A web-based application that allows a user to 
search through various Nintendo consoles or 
games and add them to a wishlist.<br>
Nintendo is a video game company that has 
at least 7 different gaming consoles and over 
4000 games.<br>
We do not plan on listing ALL of those 
games. Only a select number of games from 
each console will be used in our application.
